			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row mt centered">
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>How does it work?</h4>
				<p>You'll work in teams of up to 6 makers to design and 3D print your creation. Only fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers are allowed. Teams will be provided with a theme/challenge during the beginning of the Printathon, which although not mandatory, will influence the judgement of your creation. Printing starts on Saturday morning and goes on for 24 hours straight.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>Can I register alone? How big should teams be?</h4>
				<p>Yes! If you are alone or don't have enough people to make a team, you'll be able to form one at the beginning of the event. Teams should be groups of up to 6 people, and your teammates can be from different universities.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
				<p>The event is completely free! We'll provide food and drinks, as well as shared printers to be used throughout the event.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row mt centered">
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>Should my team bring a printer and filament?</h4>
				<p>Teams are encouraged to bring their own printers and any specific filament they plan to use. We'll attempt to provide every team with at least 2 printers. We will have PLA filament for the event, but teams are encouraged to bring their own filament. Due to space constrains, teams are not allowed to bring more than 5 printers.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>How do I register?</h4>
				<p>We'll Just click the register button up above, and complete your registration trough eventbrite. Registrations work on a first come first serve basis, so be sure to register as soon as possible. You can register as individuals and then state your teamamtes preferences, so don't worry about having your whole team register at once.

		<div class="row mt centered">
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>What hardware will be available?</h4>
				<p>Deis3D will provide some shared 3D printers, PLA filament, soldering stations, and tools for making small printer repairs. Additionally, some computers with MakerBot desktop, Cura, Slic3r, and Simplify3D will be available for slicing prints. These items may be in high demand, so we recommend bringing team gear if possible.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h4>What should I make?</h4>
				<p>Teams will be provided with a theme/challenge during the beginning of the competition, but teams can choose anything to make. You can come with an idea in mind, but we ask that you do not start building or CADing anything before the event starts. We encourage all kinds of ideas, whether it's a proof of concept, a model, or a prototype. Whatever you choose to make, do your best to sell your ideas to the judges.
