# Printathon-Fall2015

The website for the Printathon for Fall 2015 - a usually bi-yearly, 3D-printing-based hackathon hosted by Deis3D, Brandeis' 3D printing club. 

The website used to be hosted [here](http://printathon.org) but has since then been updated to the newer version. The preserved version of this code can be viewed [here](http://ssemenova.github.io/Printathon-Fall2015/index.html).
